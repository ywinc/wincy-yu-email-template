BVT Project: Create an email UI

Languages: HTML, CSS

The project must meet the following requirements:

Create an Email Template. Please Use the Bootstrap Library and the Bootstrap Grid System. The point of this assignment is not just to make an HTML Template, but to practice utilizing bootstrap grid. Bootstrap grid is just a system of pre-written classes and media queries. Bootstrap grid utilizes the functionality of the CSS Flexbox Module.

Your template should have 3 sections like the reference photo. The page should take the full windows’s view, and there shouldn’t be any margin on the sides of the window (use container-fluid instead of container)

You will want to make sure to design the template so that the different sections of the page display differently and clearly when the viewport is resized. You can easily acomplish this with Bootstrap Grid’s column classes.
